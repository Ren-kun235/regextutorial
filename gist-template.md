# Regex Tutorial: Matching a URL

A regular expression (regex), is a combination of characters that form a unique search pattern. They can be used dynamically and are more unique because they can search for a broader range of strings. Regex's typically consist of special characters to define the search criteria. This method would allow for a much quicker and broader range of strings set in the code that a developer may want to change, rather than a singular and defined string.

## Summary

This tutorial will breakdown the elements contained in a regex for finding URL(s).
The following regex will be used in this example to further the understanding of how regex's work and how to easily translate them.

Regex: /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
